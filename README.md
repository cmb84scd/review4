A company that makes academic maths papers easier to read. The product scans through the maths paper, looking for sums and extracts those sums as strings. Then it evaulates those sums and then it evaulates the original sum string along with the evaulated result. Looking to move to a more modern tech stack and would like me to build a prototype of this system.
`string_calcuator`

The extracted sum string is provided and I should provide them with the extracted sum string plus the result.
The sum could be any sum.

Example:
"1 + 2" => ["1 + 2", 3]

input | output
'1 + 2' | ['1 + 2', 3]
